        Homework 6 pt2 

        I chose to represent housing insecurity in North Carolina counties. It is possible through these maps to see the differences between counties and the counties with the highest rates of poverty. The classification that you chose should be representative of the data. For example, it would not make sense to use a pie chart to represent all 100 counties of North Carolina because it would be difficult for the audience to interpret.
